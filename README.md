# Minimax Tic Tac Toe Game
Minimax Tic Tac Toe Game with an AI bot to play against. 

This project was created as my final assignment for CS152 course: Harnessing Artificial Intelligence Algorithms in my third year at university.

# Technologies and Lessons

I used the following technologies
1) Python
2) Libraries: random and copy

In this project I practiced and learned the following concepts:

1) Minimax algorithm for adversarial games (search algorithms)
2) OOP programming
3) Optimizing algorithms by adding alpha beta pruning to the minimax algorithm
4) Creating a bot player for a real scenario game
5) Using a decorator function for memoization
6) Documenting code with comments and docstrings

# How to view and use the project?

All of the code can be found in the Jupyter notebook. The explanations are in chronological order with 5 different stages of the project: from a simple human vs human game all the way to a playing against a smart bot that uses minimax algorithm with evaluation function, alpha beta pruning, and memoization to make decisions. I advise going through the cells in the notebook in order.
